# Android Development Projects

This repository contains all the Android development projects I worked on during my high school years. It showcases my journey and growth as an Android developer. Take a look at the projects to get an idea of the skills I acquired and the applications I built.

Each Project has a regular version where I would showcase the basics of the topic and an "Fun" version where I would experiment and add some fun features to the project.

Feel free to explore the individual project folders for more details and source code.
